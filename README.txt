<!--Cybersecurity Disclaimer â€“ Ethical Hacking Activities

This document serves as a disclaimer regarding ethical hacking practices and cybersecurity activities undertaken for educational, research, or authorized security assessments.

    Legal Compliance
    All ethical hacking activities must be conducted strictly within the boundaries of applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards. Unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or data without explicit permission from the owner is illegal and punishable under various national and international cybersecurity laws.

    Authorization & Consent
    Any penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, or security auditing must have explicit written consent from the system or network owner before execution. Engaging in unauthorized cybersecurity testing, even with good intentions, may lead to legal consequences.

    Responsible Disclosure
    Ethical hackers must adhere to responsible disclosure guidelines, reporting any discovered vulnerabilities privately and exclusively to the respective organization or system owner, allowing sufficient time for remediation before public disclosure.

    No Malicious Intent
    Ethical hacking is performed solely for security enhancement, education, and research purposes. Any exploitation of vulnerabilities for personal gain, data theft, unauthorized access, or disruption of services is strictly prohibited.

    Limitation of Liability
    The author, organization, or entity providing cybersecurity knowledge or training does not assume liability for any misuse of ethical hacking techniques. Any individual or entity engaging in cybersecurity activities does so at their own risk and responsibility.

    Educational & Research Purposes Only
    All information, tools, methodologies, and demonstrations related to ethical hacking are shared for educational purposes only. Any use of this knowledge for illegal activities is strongly discouraged, and the individual will be solely responsible for any consequences.

    Compliance with Code of Ethics
    Ethical hackers are expected to follow recognized industry codes of conduct, such as those outlined by:
        EC-Council (Certified Ethical Hacker - CEH)
        Offensive Security (OSCP)
        (ISC)Â² Code of Ethics
        The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
        Other relevant cybersecurity laws and regulations

    Monitoring & Reporting
    If any suspicious activity is detected, it should be reported to the appropriate cybersecurity authority or the affected organization immediately. Ethical hackers must ensure that their activities do not inadvertently cause harm or unauthorized data exposure.

Final Note

By engaging in cybersecurity research or ethical hacking, you acknowledge and agree to adhere to the above principles, ensuring that all activities are conducted legally, ethically, and responsibly.

Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in legal action, reputational damage, or professional disqualification from cybersecurity certifications and organizations.
